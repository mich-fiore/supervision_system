Purpose:
This layer supports action management in the supervision system. In general when creating
a new scenario developers can introduce their own actions by importing the action_nodes library and extending
- the Action class for actions that needs only to be monitored
- The ExecutableAction class for actions that need also to be executed and have special mechanisms for execution
- The BasicAction class for actions that need also to be executed and that simply call the MotionPlanner 

Each action provides services to check its preconditions and to set its postconditions. Using this mechanism we can add new actions to the system without recompiling or changing the situation_assessment_actions layer.
