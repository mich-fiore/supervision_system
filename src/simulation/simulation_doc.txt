Purpose: This layer introduces a way to move tf frames in the environment using a Joypad or a
Keyboard


ToDo:
At the moment the Keyboard interface has more functions than the Joypad. Both should be set at the same. The package name tf_joypad is not correct also, since both keyboard and joypad are supported.

Dependencies:
None

tf_joypad/launch/launch_joypad.launch
